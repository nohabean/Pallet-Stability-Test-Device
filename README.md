# Pallet Stability Test Device

A device created to test the stability and strength of packaging in a palletized load on a small scale. Simulates the pack on the bottom corner of a palletized load with weights on top. This device then pulls that load with the weights forward until the maximum shear force that the pack can withstand before failure is found. Coded using C++ in the Arduino IDE.
